        <p>Outstanding career success can often seem out of reach. We know that to succeed, we need both ability and opportunity. But when it comes to advancing past a certain point, access to the right opportunity can become the most limiting factor. To better understand how to optimize for opportunity, I studied the career paths of 11 people who were at least engineering directors or principal engineers. Here&rsquo;s what I found.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering managers:</strong></p>
<p>All three of these managers had a similar story: they worked on a product that was a top company priority, grew a ton, and had outstanding business impact. These managers’ careers grew as quickly as their teams did.</p>
<p>These managers optimized for opportunity by leading teams which were working on mission critical projects. In some cases, they were intentional about working on top company priorities and in other cases they got lucky because the product they were working on became a top priority. Either way, working on top company priorities gave them access to more resources since leadership was invested. In one manager’s case, she had direct time with top executives and dedicated executive coaching when she needed it.</p>
<p>They also invested into building the necessary skills to take advantage of growth opportunities. The skill set these managers needed changed as their teams scaled. They learned how to prioritize and work through delegation more to be able to take advantage of these opportunities. One manager’s thought on prioritization resonated with me:</p>
<p><em>&gt; “Spending the time to make something that is going well go amazing is often higher impact than getting something from poor to passable”.</em></p>
<p><strong>Product Engineers:</strong></p>
<p>These product engineers' growth also came from working on products that were growing and having tremendous business impact. Along the way they developed organizational trust from their strong track records.</p>
<p>These product engineers had more agency and control over opportunity than the engineering managers. They could pick projects that interested them and use prototyping to realize their ideas. One engineer’s thought describes this well:</p>
<p><em>&gt; “As engineers, we have the unique ability to just build our ideas. Taking something out of the abstract and making it concrete does wonders for advancing a discussion. There’s no substitute for experiencing a product yourself, especially when that experience is delightful. I’ve always looked for simple ways to prototype and get products into dogfooding sooner”</em></p>
<p>These engineers optimized for opportunity in a few ways. They developed organizational trust by delivering on top projects which gave them access to more opportunities. They were often the first people asked to help out when mission critical projects came along. Also, these engineers were often proactive in seeking out the top projects and working with the most skilled people at the company. One of the engineers even made it a point to go from project to project with the most skilled designer at the company.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Engineers:</strong></p>
<p>These infrastructure engineers all solved high-leverage problems which improved large parts of the engineering organization. They had a huge compounding effect by making drastic improvements to developer tooling or solving problems in the underlying infrastructure every engineer uses.</p>
<p>These infrastructure engineers seemed to have the most agency in creating opportunities. Across the board, each engineer champions the quote “code wins arguments”. Prototyping and proving their ideas allowed them to create opportunities. None of them mean this as a way to solve problems single-handedly, but use it as a tool to get consensus. One of the engineers summarizes this by saying: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”.</p>
<p>These engineers optimized for opportunity by putting themselves in a position to get lucky. They were proactive in chasing the top problems for the engineering organization. Oftentimes, these engineers worked on these problems outside of their team&rsquo;s scope with their spare time. Aside from being proactive, they also invested into continuing their engineering education. They would pair with domain experts and read technical books to learn skills needed to chase new high-leverage problems.</p>
<p><strong>Summary and recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>All 11 of these people were lucky to be working at an incredibly successful, growing company. <strong>Growing companies are much more likely to have opportunities for career growth since “a rising tide lifts all boats”</strong>. If your current company doesn’t have that potential for growth, you may want to consider switching. Aside from joining a growing company, these people did three things that increased their chances of finding the right opportunity.</p>
<p>First, they <strong>sought out business critical projects that excited them</strong>. It’s not enough that their projects were a top priority, but also it’s important that they were passionate about their projects. It motivated them to do higher quality work and put more time in which led to better outcomes. If you are not passionate about what you are working on, or it is not critical to the success of your company, talk to your manager to see if anything can be done. If the chat with your manager doesn’t change anything, then you can also look to switch teams or companies with this in mind.</p>
<p>Second, they <strong>were intentional about working with the most talented people they knew.</strong> This helped them achieve more through their collaborations. Not to mention this increases chances of future opportunities since talented people are often working on impactful projects. To do this, factor in the talent of your peers when choosing what to work on and who to collaborate with. This is a lot easier if you’re working on a team with generally talented people.</p>
<p>Lastly, they all <strong>honed their skills and delivered high quality work</strong>. Their skill growth increased the chances that they succeeded once the right opportunity presented itself. Collaborating closely with domain experts and reading &ldquo;subject-killing&rdquo; resources are two ways to develop your skills. Most domains have a “subject-killing” resource  (e.g. <em>High Output Management</em> for eng management) which will tell you most of the critical information you need to know. Also, their track record helped them have access to more opportunities down the road. To establish a strong track record, always hold a high bar for the quality and polish of your work. It will pay off over time.</p>
<p>Extraordinary career growth isn’t something that many will achieve even if they have the necessary ability. Growth at the highest levels requires access to increasingly scarce opportunities so it’s not something you should expect. However, you can definitely increase your chances with these behavior changes. Hope this is helpful, enjoy the ride and good luck.</p>
