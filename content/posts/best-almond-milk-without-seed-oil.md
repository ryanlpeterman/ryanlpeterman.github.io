title: "Best Almond Milk Without Seed Oil?"

<p><em>tl;dr: they all don't taste as good as the ones with seed oil, but "Califia Farms Organic Unsweetened Almond Milk" tasted the best. After some deeper research, I don't think seed oils are unhealthy anymore though so I won't be drinking any of these in the future.</em></p>
<h1 id=the-taste-test>The Taste Test</h1><p>I've been drinking plant milk for a while because I have mild lactose intolerance and figured plant milk was healthier. I saw on social media somewhere that seed oils in your plant milk were inflammatory. Seemed reasonable so I set out to find a plant milk without seed oils in it.</p>
<p>After some research, I found three highly acclaimed brands to try out. My friend and I blind taste-tested them to find which one was best and here are the results:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Califia Farms Organic Unsweetened Almond Milk</strong> - best taste and texture all around</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>MALK Almond Milk, Unsweetened</strong> - similar to Califia except just slightly more watery and had a less pleasant aftertaste</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Elmhurst Unsweetened Almond Milk</strong> - worst taste, tasted the most watery and had a slight acidic aftertaste</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, they all had poor texture and taste compared to what I'm used to. Would not recommend any of these.</p>
<h1 id=are-seed-oils-unhealthy>Are Seed Oils Unhealthy?</h1><p>They are certainly healthier than animal oils and claims that seed oils are inflammatory are disputed. It depends on if you have an unusually bad balance of Omega-6s to Omega-3s in your diet. Not worth thinking about for your average person.</p>
<p>There's also <a href='https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1859624338632343643'>a good thread from Bryan Johnson</a> that disputes claims that seed oils are unhealthy.</p>
<p>Here's the ChatGPT Deep Research for future reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sunflower, canola, and rapeseed oils, as used in plant-based milks, are generally beneficial or neutral for health when consumed in moderation. They are high in unsaturated fats (omega-6 and omega-3) that are essential for the body and have been linked to improved cardiovascular outcomes (like lower LDL cholesterol and reduced heart disease risk) (sources: <a href='https://heart.org'>AHA</a>, <a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov'>PubMed</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These oils are low in saturated fat and contain helpful micronutrients (vitamin E, vitamin K, phytosterols) (sources: <a href='https://healthline.com'>Healthline</a>, <a href='https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu'>Harvard Nutrition Source</a>), aligning them with heart-healthy dietary patterns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fears that seed oils “cause inflammation” are not supported by the bulk of scientific evidence – at typical intake levels, they do not drive chronic inflammation or immune dysfunction (sources: <a href='https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com'>Lipid World</a>, <a href='https://heart.org'>AHA</a>). In fact, balancing omega-6 and omega-3 fats is what’s important, and canola oil excels in that balance (source: <a href='https://healthline.com'>Healthline</a>). Sunflower oil, being higher in omega-6, should ideally be paired with omega-3 sources, but the small amount in plant milk is unlikely to upset the ratio significantly. Meta-analyses of trials show no increase in inflammatory markers from higher linoleic acid consumption (source: <a href='https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com'>Lipid World</a>), and overall mortality is not raised by omega-6 intake – one review even found it associated with slightly lower all-cause mortality (sources: <a href='https://public-health.uq.edu.au'>UQ Public Health</a>, <a href='https://public-health.uq.edu.au'>UQ Public Health</a>).</p>
