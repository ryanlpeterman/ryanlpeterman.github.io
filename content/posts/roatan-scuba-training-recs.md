<p>If you're looking to get scuba trained, you might consider Roatan. Did 12 dives in 4 days to get my Open Water and Advanced Open Water scuba certifications. Went to Roatan since <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/gogzlk/comment/frfvso7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button'>Reddit said it was a top place to dive</a>.</p>
<p>We picked <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/GJ1Wb1TA4yzF2anZ7'>Roatan Divers</a> because it was highly rated and they were great.</p>
<p>Best Dives: Across 12 dives, the best two were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Night Dive</strong> - Incredible because of the <a href='https://sundiversroatan.com/2021/06/01/string-of-pearls-roatan/'>"string of pearls"</a>. When all lights are off, you get to see hundreds of glowing dots of light falling all around you like rain. Cameras can't pick up these lights well so it's something best seen with your own eyes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mary's Place</strong> - Highest density of sea life and vibrant coral that we saw. The terrain is also interesting since you get to swim through little caverns of coral.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Best Food:Â </p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/Rrt6uBn2RhK2j4eN8'>Anthony's Chicken</a> - Amazing jerk chicken. Not only is it the best tasting, but it's also on the cheaper side.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/Twy9VD1XnhW1pzMH6'>Sea Salt</a> - Best meal we had without considering price. It's a fancy place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
