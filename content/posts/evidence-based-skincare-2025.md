<p>I've dabbled in skincare for a while but often just bought whatever Reddit said was good. I never really did deep research on what would move the needle. On a flight back from Taiwan, I spent a few hours researching what an optimal, evidence-based skincare routine would look like.</p>
<h3 id=the-most-important-ingredients>The Most Important Ingredients</h3><p>Before picking out products, I wanted to learn what ingredients would have the most impact based on current skincare research. ChatGPT deep research mode using the O1 model helped me do this digging. Here's what I came up with:</p>
<p>Helpful for anyone:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)</strong> - gentle, all-in-one ingredient for hydration, anti-aging, acne control and redness reduction<ul>
<li>Look for: 2-5% for effectiveness; higher may irritate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Retinoids (Tretinoin)</strong> - powerful, evidenced backed active ingredient for acne and anti-aging benefits</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin C</strong> - fights aging, fades discoloration, and reduces inflammation</li>
<li><strong>Hyaluronic Acid</strong> - gentle hydration superstar<ul>
<li>Look for: multi-molecular weight or 0.5-2% total HA</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ceramides</strong> - healing and protecting barrier for the skin<ul>
<li>Look for: 0.5-1%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>50+ SPF (physical or chemical ok)</strong> - protects against aging and sun damage</li>
<li><strong>Omega 3 supplements</strong> - calms skin inflammation (2-3g per day from most studies)</li>
<li><strong>Collagen Peptide supplements</strong> - helps maintain skin firmness and combat aging (5-10g per day most effective in studies)</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific for my skincare concerns (sensitive skin, redness, acne):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green Tea Polyphenols</strong> - boosts skin’s clarity and calms redness</li>
<li><strong>Azelaic Acid</strong> - clears acne, evens skin, and reduces redness</li>
<li><strong>(Maybe) Salicylic Acid</strong> - clears pores and helps with acne but trades off with redness and irritation</li>
</ul>
