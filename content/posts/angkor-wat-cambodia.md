<p>Followed what Reddit said and had an amazing trip 2 day. Would highly recommend what we did if you want to see Angkor Wat. Here's everything you need to know to have a similar trip:</p>
<p><strong>Hotel</strong> - <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/iwBGYXEDoka1soj3A'>Park Hyatt in Siem Reap</a> was a consistent top choice according to several Reddit threads. It was worth it and so convenient. They arranged everything for us (airport transport, private tour of Angkor Wat, and incredible food onsite). The trade off was cost but the prices weren't too bad. Rough cost breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Room = ~$200 per night</li>
<li>Breakfast = complimentary (the food was incredible)</li>
<li>Lunch / Dinner = ~$30 per person</li>
<li>Private Tour Guide = ~$100 total</li>
<li>Airport transport = ~$100 total each way (only thing I felt was price gouging, the rest was reasonable)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visas</strong> - You can come unprepared and just do Visa on arrival at the airport
<strong>Flights</strong> - Nearest airport is the SAI airport</p>
<p>For Angkor Wat, we didn't buy our tickets in advance. It was easy to do everything the day of with the tour guide.</p>
