<p>Went to Taiwan (Taipei, Tainan, Taroko Gorge, Sun Moon Lake) for 20 days, tried dozens of restaurants and went to all the popular spots. Here are the top 3 places I ate at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/wzbWzLrj6zpSHMWRA'>Best Taiwanese Beef Noodle: Halal Chinese Beef Noodles</a></li>
<li><a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/DeiRv6nptDV815cs7'>Best Night Market Food: Fuzhou Pepper Buns (in Raohe night market)</a></li>
<li><a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/BiBPojSpfcfBvDaZ7'>Memorable Duck Place: Xiang Duck Taipei</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Top destination</strong>: Taroko Gorge for sure. It's a national park in Taiwan with unique landscapes. We rented e-bikes from Hualien and biked up to it. We also stayed at an upscale hotel inside the park called <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/28RiiP5aS56e9E3W7'>"Silk's Place"</a>. Highly recommend staying there if you don't mind the price.</p>
<p><strong>Honorable food mention</strong>: If you like Taiwanese beef noodle soup, there's a great place called <a href='https://maps.app.goo.gl/KoV7vhPyjEafpCz69'>Yongkang Beef Noodles</a> which has super rich broth. Some people say it's a tourist trap, I say it's delicious.</p>
