Zuck ([IG Post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkihQRtO5yO/), [FB Post](https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/884058129426425/)) and some news outlets ([ex1](https://thenewstack.io/how-instagram-prepared-for-a-tsunami-of-high-definition-video/), [ex2](https://siliconangle.com/2022/11/04/meta-develops-new-hardware-efficient-video-processing-method/), [ex3](https://enterprisetalk.com/quick-bytes/meta-creates-a-brand-new-hardware-effective-video-processing-technique/), [ex4](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/instagram-decreases-video-compute-time-by-94-without-updating-hardware)) highlighted some of the work our team did in video compute efficiency.

We reduced the cost to produce our basic video encodings by 94%. As a byproduct we were able to use that compute to improve advanced encoding watchtime coverage by 33%. These advanced encodings improve the user experience through higher visual quality and less stalls. If this sounds interesting to you, I wrote an [engineering blog post with all the engineering details here](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/04/video-engineering/instagram-video-processing-encoding-reduction/)
